# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses two related issues in the application:
1. User videos are not being displayed on the profile page
2. There's a TypeScript error in the Feed component related to accessing the `profiles` property on video objects

These issues are preventing users from seeing their uploaded videos on their profile pages and causing potential runtime errors in the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my uploaded videos on my profile page, so that I can view and manage my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits their own profile page THEN the system SHALL display all videos they have uploaded
2. WHEN a user visits another user's profile page THEN the system SHALL display all public videos uploaded by that user
3. WHEN videos are displayed on the profile page THEN the system SHALL show thumbnails, duration, and other relevant metadata
4. WHEN a user uploads a new video THEN the system SHALL update the profile page to include the new video

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the TypeScript error in the Feed component, so that the application runs without errors and properly filters videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Feed component fetches videos THEN the system SHALL properly include profile data in the query
2. WHEN filtering videos THEN the system SHALL safely access the profiles property without TypeScript errors
3. WHEN a profile is deactivated THEN the system SHALL properly filter out videos from that profile
4. WHEN the code is compiled THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript errors related to accessing the profiles property
