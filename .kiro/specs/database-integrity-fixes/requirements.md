# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical database integrity issues in the video platform application, specifically focusing on fixing like counts, follow relationships, comment counts, view tracking, and resolving Supabase mutable search path security warnings. The current system has inconsistent data synchronization between the frontend React components and the Supabase database, leading to incorrect counts and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Security Compliance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all database functions to comply with Supabase security standards, so that the application is secure and free from mutable search path warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any database function is executed THEN the system SHALL use a fixed search_path to prevent security vulnerabilities
2. WHEN the database is queried THEN the system SHALL show zero mutable search path warnings
3. IF a function uses SECURITY DEFINER THEN the system SHALL explicitly set search_path to 'public'

### Requirement 2: Accurate Like Count Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want like counts to be accurate and consistent across all parts of the application, so that I can trust the engagement metrics displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user likes a video THEN the system SHALL automatically increment the like_count in the videos table
2. WHEN a user unlikes a video THEN the system SHALL automatically decrement the like_count in the videos table
3. WHEN like_count is updated THEN the system SHALL prevent negative values
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display accurate like counts that match the database
5. IF a duplicate like is attempted THEN the system SHALL prevent the duplicate and maintain count accuracy

### Requirement 3: Reliable Follow Relationship Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to follow and unfollow other users reliably, so that my social connections are accurately maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user follows another user THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate follow relationships
2. WHEN a user unfollows another user THEN the system SHALL remove the relationship completely
3. WHEN follow status is checked THEN the system SHALL return accurate current status
4. IF concurrent follow/unfollow operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle them without data corruption

### Requirement 4: Accurate Comment Count Tracking

**User Story:** As a user, I want comment counts to accurately reflect the number of comments on videos, so that I can gauge engagement levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a comment is added to a video THEN the system SHALL automatically increment the comment_count
2. WHEN a comment is deleted from a video THEN the system SHALL automatically decrement the comment_count
3. WHEN comment_count is updated THEN the system SHALL prevent negative values
4. WHEN the application displays videos THEN the system SHALL show accurate comment counts

### Requirement 5: Genuine View Count Tracking

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want view counts to reflect genuine views from other users, so that I can accurately measure my content's reach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user watches a video for 10+ seconds THEN the system SHALL record one view if they haven't viewed it before
2. WHEN a creator views their own video THEN the system SHALL NOT count it as a view
3. WHEN a user views the same video multiple times THEN the system SHALL only count it once
4. WHEN view_count is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect only genuine external views
5. WHEN the view tracking function is called THEN the system SHALL update the videos table automatically

### Requirement 6: Consistent Frontend Data Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want all engagement metrics (likes, comments, views, follows) to be consistent across different parts of the application, so that the interface is reliable and trustworthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN engagement data is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the same values in all components
2. WHEN a user interacts with engagement features THEN the system SHALL update all relevant UI elements immediately
3. WHEN data changes occur THEN the system SHALL propagate updates to all active components
4. IF network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and maintain data consistency

### Requirement 7: Database Trigger Reliability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all database triggers to function reliably, so that data integrity is maintained automatically without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database triggers are created THEN the system SHALL ensure they execute without errors
2. WHEN triggers update counts THEN the system SHALL complete the operation atomically
3. WHEN multiple triggers affect the same data THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicts
4. IF a trigger fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and maintain data consistency
