- [ ] 3.2 Create view count update triggers
  - Create trigger function to update videos.view_count when video_views changes
  - Implement trigger for INSERT and DELETE on video_views table
  - Test view counting with different user scenarios
  - _Requirements: 5.5, 7.1, 7.2_

- [ ] 4. Implement comment count management system

  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 4.2 Create comment count triggers
  - Create trigger for comments INSERT to increment counts
  - Create trigger for comments DELETE to decrement counts
  - Test comment count accuracy with sample operations
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 7.1, 7.2_

- [ ] 5. Implement secure follow relationship management
- [ ] 5.1 Create secure follow management function
  - Write handle_follow_relationship() function with proper security
