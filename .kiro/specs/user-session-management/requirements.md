# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive user session management system that handles session creation, validation, and cleanup for authenticated users. The system will provide secure session handling with proper token generation, storage, and lifecycle management to support user authentication flows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create user sessions with unique tokens, so that users can maintain authenticated state across requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL create a new session with a unique session token
2. WHEN creating a session THEN the system SHALL generate a UUID as the session identifier
3. WHEN creating a session THEN the system SHALL store the session token, user ID, and creation timestamp
4. IF a session already exists for a user THEN the system SHALL either update the existing session or create a new one based on configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible session creation functions, so that I can create sessions with different data structures based on application needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a session with minimal data THEN the system SHALL accept only a session token and return a UUID
2. WHEN creating a session with user context THEN the system SHALL accept user_id and session_data as JSON and return a UUID
3. WHEN creating a session with custom session ID THEN the system SHALL accept user_id and session_id as text and return a UUID
4. WHEN session creation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want session functions to be secure, so that unauthorized users cannot manipulate session data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any session function is called THEN the system SHALL execute with SECURITY DEFINER privileges
2. WHEN accessing session data THEN the system SHALL validate user permissions
3. WHEN creating sessions THEN the system SHALL use secure random token generation
4. WHEN storing session data THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate input parameters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want my sessions to be properly managed, so that I have a consistent authentication experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is created THEN the system SHALL set appropriate expiration times
2. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up expired sessions
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the associated session
4. WHEN checking session validity THEN the system SHALL verify both existence and expiration status
