# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves systematically removing all code and functions related to likes, views, comments, and follow/following functionality from the application, then incrementally adding them back one at a time while resolving errors as they occur. This approach will help isolate issues, ensure proper functionality of each feature, and create a more stable codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all likes-related code from the application, so that I can eliminate any bugs or issues related to the likes functionality and start with a clean slate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all likes-related code is removed THEN the application SHALL compile without any likes-related errors
2. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL function normally without any likes functionality
3. WHEN database migrations are applied THEN all likes-related tables, functions, and triggers SHALL be removed or disabled
4. WHEN the frontend is loaded THEN no likes-related UI components SHALL be visible or functional

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all views-related code from the application, so that I can eliminate any bugs or issues related to the views functionality and prepare for clean reimplementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all views-related code is removed THEN the application SHALL compile without any views-related errors
2. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL function normally without any views tracking functionality
3. WHEN database migrations are applied THEN all views-related tables, functions, and triggers SHALL be removed or disabled
4. WHEN the frontend is loaded THEN no views-related UI components SHALL be visible or functional

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all comments-related code from the application, so that I can eliminate any bugs or issues related to the comments functionality and prepare for clean reimplementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all comments-related code is removed THEN the application SHALL compile without any comments-related errors
2. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL function normally without any comments functionality
3. WHEN database migrations are applied THEN all comments-related tables, functions, and triggers SHALL be removed or disabled
4. WHEN the frontend is loaded THEN no comments-related UI components SHALL be visible or functional

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all follow/following-related code from the application, so that I can eliminate any bugs or issues related to the social following functionality and prepare for clean reimplementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all follow/following-related code is removed THEN the application SHALL compile without any follow-related errors
2. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL function normally without any social following functionality
3. WHEN database migrations are applied THEN all follow-related tables, functions, and triggers SHALL be removed or disabled
4. WHEN the frontend is loaded THEN no follow/following-related UI components SHALL be visible or functional

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to incrementally add back the likes functionality, so that I can ensure it works properly in isolation before adding other features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN likes functionality is re-implemented THEN the application SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN a user interacts with like buttons THEN the likes SHALL be properly recorded and displayed
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN all likes-related functions and triggers SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN the application runs THEN only likes functionality SHALL be active while other removed features remain inactive

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to incrementally add back the views functionality, so that I can ensure it works properly alongside the likes functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN views functionality is re-implemented THEN the application SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN a user views content THEN the view counts SHALL be properly tracked and displayed
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN all views-related functions and triggers SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN the application runs THEN both likes and views functionality SHALL work together without conflicts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to incrementally add back the comments functionality, so that I can ensure it works properly alongside existing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comments functionality is re-implemented THEN the application SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN a user creates, edits, or deletes comments THEN the operations SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN all comments-related functions and triggers SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN the application runs THEN likes, views, and comments functionality SHALL work together without conflicts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to incrementally add back the follow/following functionality, so that I can ensure the complete social feature set works properly together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN follow/following functionality is re-implemented THEN the application SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN a user follows or unfollows another user THEN the operations SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN all follow-related functions and triggers SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN the application runs THEN all social features (likes, views, comments, follows) SHALL work together without conflicts

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve errors incrementally during each feature addition, so that I can maintain a stable codebase throughout the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during feature re-implementation THEN it SHALL be resolved before proceeding to the next feature
2. WHEN each feature is added THEN comprehensive testing SHALL be performed to ensure stability
3. WHEN conflicts arise between features THEN they SHALL be resolved immediately
4. WHEN the process is complete THEN the application SHALL have all features working correctly with no outstanding errors
