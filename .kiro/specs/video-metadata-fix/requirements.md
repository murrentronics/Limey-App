# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses an issue with video metadata (cover thumbnail and duration) not being properly inserted into the database when creating videos. Currently, when a user creates a video, the cover thumbnail and duration are not being saved correctly, resulting in videos showing "no cover" and "0:00" duration on the profile page. The metadata is only updated if the user explicitly changes the cover image after video creation. This feature will ensure that video metadata is properly captured and stored during the initial video creation process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my video's cover thumbnail to be automatically generated and saved when I create a video, so that my videos display properly in my profile without requiring additional steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new video THEN the system SHALL automatically generate and save a cover thumbnail
2. WHEN a video is displayed in the profile page THEN it SHALL show the correct cover thumbnail without requiring manual updates
3. WHEN the "generate thumbnail" feature is used THEN it SHALL properly update the cover thumbnail in the database
4. WHEN a video is uploaded THEN the cover thumbnail SHALL be visible immediately after processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my video's duration to be automatically calculated and saved when I create a video, so that the correct duration is displayed in my profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new video THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate and save the video duration
2. WHEN a video is displayed in the profile page THEN it SHALL show the correct duration instead of "0:00"
3. WHEN the video metadata is updated THEN the duration SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN a video is uploaded THEN the duration SHALL be calculated accurately based on the video file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure consistent metadata handling across all video creation methods, so that users have a uniform experience regardless of how they create videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video is created through any method THEN the metadata handling SHALL be consistent
2. WHEN metadata extraction fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallbacks or error messages
3. WHEN video processing is complete THEN all metadata SHALL be properly stored in the database
4. WHEN the database schema changes THEN the metadata handling SHALL adapt accordingly
