# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze current real-time subscription implementation


  - Review the existing real-time subscription code in Profile.tsx
  - Identify potential issues with event handling for follow vs. unfollow actions
  - Examine how the payload structure differs between follow and unfollow events
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_



- [ ] 2. Debug and fix the real-time subscription handler
  - Add logging to track payload structure for both follow and unfollow events
  - Ensure the subscription correctly identifies both types of events


  - Fix any conditional logic that might be treating the events differently
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Update the follow/unfollow UI handling


  - Ensure consistent UI updates for both follow and unfollow actions
  - Implement proper loading states during follow/unfollow operations
  - Add error handling with UI feedback for failed operations
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_




- [ ] 4. Enhance the fetchFollowCounts function
  - Optimize the query for retrieving follower counts
  - Ensure it's called consistently for both follow and unfollow events
  - Add error handling for failed count retrievals
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

- [ ] 5. Test the real-time updates across multiple profiles
  - Verify follower counts update in real-time for both follow and unfollow actions
  - Test with multiple browser sessions viewing the same profile
  - Ensure consistency after page refreshes
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 2.3_
