# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses an issue with real-time follower count updates in the application. Currently, when a user unfollows another user from their profile, the follower count decreases immediately on the other user's profile, but when a user follows another user, the follower count on the other user's profile doesn't update in real-time. This inconsistency creates a confusing user experience and needs to be fixed to ensure all social interactions are reflected immediately across the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want follower counts to update in real-time when someone follows me, so that I can see an accurate representation of my social engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user follows another user THEN the follower count SHALL update immediately on the target user's profile
2. WHEN a user unfollows another user THEN the follower count SHALL update immediately on the target user's profile
3. WHEN multiple users view the same profile THEN all instances SHALL see follower count updates in real-time
4. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the follower count SHALL remain consistent with the real-time updates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement consistent real-time subscription handling for follow actions, so that the application behavior is predictable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a follow action occurs THEN the real-time subscription SHALL trigger updates for all relevant users
2. WHEN an unfollow action occurs THEN the real-time subscription SHALL trigger updates for all relevant users
3. WHEN a user navigates between profiles THEN the subscription SHALL properly clean up and reinitialize
4. WHEN the application loads a profile THEN it SHALL establish the correct real-time subscriptions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent UI feedback when following or unfollowing users, so that I know my actions have been processed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the follow button THEN the UI SHALL immediately reflect the new follow state
2. WHEN a user clicks the unfollow button THEN the UI SHALL immediately reflect the new follow state
3. WHEN a follow/unfollow action fails THEN the UI SHALL revert to the previous state and display an error message
4. WHEN follow/unfollow actions are in progress THEN the UI SHALL indicate the loading state to prevent duplicate actions
